# Picky
The Decision Maker

#WHY

This is another program I made to practice the QT Framework. Being familiar with C++ and already having practice with QT, this was a simple project. I choose to create a program that made a decision for the user because my mother and I are always stuck on the question, "What should we eat for dinner".

#WHAT

This repository contains all the files that was used to create the program, they are located in the aptly named "Source File" folder. In the "Executable" folder you will find the program itself, feel free to use it.

You use the program by entering all the options you wish to choose from by using the "Add" button. Once you have all the possible options you want, push the "Pick!" button and the program will choose one of the options for you!

I'll be using this to choose dinner, but you can use it for other things too!

#HOW

QT Creator was used to make and compile this program.
For help with compiling the project, I recommend reading the documentation: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html
